==========

- Starting making actual design changes.
--- Removed templates from most of the code.
--- Replaced Ref class with std::shared_ptr.

2021-08-17
==========

- Added rigorous warning flags for debug mode. Debug mode is used for test suite.
- Fixed various sign conversion and comparison errors throughout the code.
- Making most of the source code consistent in using unsigned int for all appropriate variables.

2021-08-14
==========

- Added a setup tool for building tests. Created a bash script with a simple test suite.
- This also allows for the main source code of Bittree to be built as a standalone library. 

2021-08-13
==========

- Finalized the first major update to the source code: splitting the source files into header and cpp files.
- This required moving some function definitions around and making new function declarations.


2021-08-12
==========

- Finished a relatively comprehensive Unit Test. This test has two parts:
-   1. A refinement test that sets up a specific three-level mesh pattern and confirms Bittree can identify each block.
-   2. A one-by-one test of all the functions in bittree_core (except the mpi-related refine_reduce functions).

2021-08-05
==========

- Initialized repository with existing Bittree C++ source code.
- Wrote a baby test, to be greatly expanded.
- Can successfully compile Bittree, run the test, and generate a coverage report.
